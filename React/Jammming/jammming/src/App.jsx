Create components for your Jammming application. You may structure your components as you see fit, but you should have a component representing each of these core components of the interface:

App
SearchBar
SearchResults
Playlist
Tracklist
Track
Additionally, make sure that your interface has a Save To Spotify button and a Search button.
